### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `del 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("del 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `del 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Part-time private tutors

* Teach many students at the same time, all across Singapore
* Contact parents daily for administrative purposes (payment, scheduling of lessons, location of lessons, etc.)
* In contact with many other private tutors, to exchange teaching ideas and learning materials
* Type very fast, dislike using the mouse
* Face-blind
* Have a bad memory
* Use WhatsApp as their main mode of contact 
* Prefer quick filtering of contacts
* Value speed, efficiency, and minimal friction in workflows

**Value proposition**: To help private tutors seamlessly manage daily tasks in their work. These include contacting parents for announcements, administrative matters or emergencies. They can also involve contacting other tutors for pedagogical discussions or the exchange of learning materials.

In some cases, tutors may teach students at different paces, adapting their teaching methods to each student’s needs, especially in small classes. As a result, a tutor might handle two students at overlapping but not identical times (e.g., one student from 4–6pm and another from 5–7pm). Therefore, we allow users to add tuition timings with overlapping periods.

We also allow parents to include date and time information. This is helpful, especially for parents who wish to meet the tutor regularly (e.g., weekly) to discuss the student’s progress. Overall, we provide users with the flexibility to input the details that best suit their needs.

* 2c. A contact does not have the field being searched.
  * 2c1. EduConnect treats that field as absent and does not match the contact on that field.
  * Use case ends.
* 2d. The user searches with flexible time formatting such as mixed `HH:mm` / `HHmm`, or with leading spaces after a prefix.
  * 2d1. EduConnect normalizes the query before matching.
  * Use case resumes from step 3.
* 2e. The user searches for partial non-English text in a free-text field such as address.
  * 2e1. EduConnect performs the usual substring match.
  * Use case resumes from step 3.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any Mainstream OS (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as it has Java 17 installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts without a noticeable drop in performance for typical usage.
3. Should not require more than 200MB of total disk space, including the application and all stored data, for up to 1000 contacts.
4. Should respond to any user command within 1 second on a machine with at least 1GB of RAM available.
5. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
6. Should not require internet connection to function.
7. A user should be able to transfer all contact data to another computer by transferring a single contact data file.
8. Should ensure no data is lost by saving all changes to disk after every command that modifies contact data.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file.<br>
      Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `del 1`<br>
      Expected: The contact with `ID` 1 is deleted from the address book. Details of the deleted contact shown as a person card. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `del 1 2`<br>
      Expected: Both contacts with `ID` 1 and `ID` 2 are deleted together. If any ID is invalid, none are deleted.

   1. Test case: `del 3 3` (duplicate ID)<br>
      Expected: The contact with `ID` 3 is deleted similar to doing just `del 3`. Duplicate IDs are removed before the deletion starts.

   1. Test case: `del 6 6 7 7` (multiple duplicate IDs)<br>
      Expected: Contacts with `ID` 6 and `ID` 7 are deleted similar to just doing `del 6 7`.

   1. Test case: `del 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Test case: `del 01`<br>
      Expected: The same contact as `del 1` is deleted.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `del`, `del this`, `del -1`, `del x`, `...` (where `x` is not found in the address book)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Copying a contact field

1. Copying a field while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `copy 1 n/`<br>
      Expected: The name of contact `ID` 1 is copied to the clipboard. Success message is then shown.

   1. Test case: `copy 1 p/`<br>
      Expected: The phone number of contact `ID` 1 is copied to the clipboard. Success message is then shown. If the contact has no phone number stored, an error message is shown instead.

   1. Test case: `copy 1 a/`<br>
      Expected: The address of contact `ID` 1 is copied to the clipboard. Success message is then shown. If the contact has no meeting link, an error message is shown instead.

   1. Test case: `copy 1 l/`<br>
      Expected: The meeting link of contact `ID` 1 is copied to the clipboard. Success message is then shown. If the contact has no meeting link, an error message is shown instead.

   1. Test case: `copy 1 email` (invalid field)<br>
      Expected: Error message shown listing the valid fields. Nothing is copied to clipboard.

   1. Test case: `copy 0 p/` (invalid ID)<br>
      Expected: Error message shown. Nothing is copied to clipboard.

   1. Test case: `copy 6767 p/` (ID not in address book)<br>
      Expected: Error message shown. Nothing is copied to clipboard.

   1. Test case: `copy 1 p/ extraArg` (extra argument)<br>
      Expected: Error message shown indicating the format is invalid. Nothing is copied to clipboard.

### Clearing all contacts

1. Clearing contacts using the two-step confirmation flow

   1. Prerequisites: Multiple contacts exist in the address book.

   1. Test case: `clear`<br>
      Expected: No contacts are deleted. A warning message is shown asking the user to type `clear` again to confirm.

   1. Test case: `clear` then `clear`<br>
      Expected: All contacts are deleted and the UI is refreshed to show an empty list.

   1. Test case: `clear` then any other command (including an invalid command) then `clear`<br>
      Expected: The second `clear` shows the warning again (the confirmation is reset).

### Finding contacts

1. Finding contacts by weekly timeslot (`d/`)

   1. Prerequisites: Ensure there is at least one contact with a stored weekly timeslot, e.g. `edit 1 d/Friday 17:00`.

   1. Test case: `find d/fri`<br>
      Expected: Shows contacts whose stored weekly timeslot is on Friday.

   1. Test case: `find d/11:00-1200`<br>
      Expected: EduConnect accepts the mixed time format and normalizes it to the same matching behavior as `find d/11:00 - 12:00`.

   1. Test case: `find d/1630-1730`<br>
      Expected: Shows contacts whose stored weekly timeslot is a single time within `16:30 - 17:30` (e.g. `17:00`).

   1. Test case: `find d/1500-1600` (when a contact has `Sunday 15:00 - 15:56` stored)<br>
      Expected: Shows the contact only if the stored duration is an exact match (`15:00 - 16:00`); a stored duration like `15:00 - 15:56` will not match.

### Parser behavior notes

* Argument values are trimmed after tokenization, so spaces immediately after a valid prefix are ignored.
* Prefixes remain lowercase and case-sensitive; capitalized forms such as `N/` and `T/` are rejected.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with a missing data file

   1. Prerequisites: Close the app.

   1. Delete the data file `[JAR file location]/data/educonnect.json` (if it exists).

   1. Launch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with sample data. The data file will be recreated the next time data is saved (after any command that modifies contacts).

1. Dealing with a corrupted data file

   1. Prerequisites: Close the app.

   1. Corrupt the data file `[JAR file location]/data/educonnect.json` (e.g. make it invalid JSON or set an invalid field value).

   1. Launch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with an empty contact list. The file will be overwritten the next time data is saved (after any command that modifies contacts).
