EduConnect is a **desktop application that enables private tutors to manage their work contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EduConnect can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## <span style="color:#FF6600;">Quick Start</span>

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F09-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for EduConnect.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar educonnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list`: List all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 a/1A Kent Ridge Rd, 119224`: Add a contact named `John Doe` with a phone number `98765432` and address `1A Kent Ridge Rd, 119224` to the Address Book.

   * `del 3`: Delete the contact with an `ID` of 3.

   * `clear` (run twice to confirm): Delete all contacts.

   * `exit`: Exit the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
   You can right-click the command box to access common text actions such as cut/copy/paste (the exact menu options may vary by OS).<br>

## <span style="color:#FF6600;">Features</span>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Student` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as empty (0 times), `t/Student`, `t/Student t/Parent`, etc.

* For more shared command behavior, see [Command Rules](#command-rules).

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Viewing help: <code>help</code></span>

💡 Opens the help window and shows how to access the full guide.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `help`
</div>

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Adding a person: <code>add</code></span>

💡 Add a person to the address book.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `add n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [a/ADDRESS] [r/REMARK] [d/WEEKLY_TIMESLOT] [l/MEETING_LINK] [t/TAG]…​`
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

* Only `n/NAME` is required.
* `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `a/ADDRESS`, `r/REMARK`, `d/WEEKLY_TIMESLOT`, `l/MEETING_LINK`, and `t/TAG` are optional (see [Command Rules](#command-rules) for shared constraints and behavior such as empty values).

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe t/Student p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/new student`
* `add n/John Doe a/John street, block 123, #01-01 t/Parent t/Tutor`
* `add n/Jane Doe p/98765432 l/https://zoom.us/j/123456789`

The first example gives the following expected output:

![result for 'add n/John Doe t/Student p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/new student'](images/AddCommandResult.png)

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Listing all persons: <code>list</code></span>

💡 Shows all contacts currently stored in the address book.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `list`
</div>

* The number of people currently in the contact list will also be shown.

Examples:
* `list`

The example gives the following expected output:

![result for 'list'](images/ListCommandResult.png)

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Editing a person: <code>edit</code></span>

💡 Edit an existing person in the address book.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `edit ID [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [d/WEEKLY_TIMESLOT] [r/REMARK] [l/MEETING_LINK] [t/TAG]… [tdel/TAG]…​`
</div>

* `ID` specifies the person to be edited.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values (see [Command Rules](#command-rules) for shared constraints and how to clear fields using empty values such as `p/`, `d/`, or `t/`).

Tag rules:
* Use this command for all tag updates. EduConnect does not provide a separate `tag` command.
* `t/TAG` adds tags; `tdel/TAG` removes tags.
* Only valid tags may be used: `Student`, `Parent`, `Tutor` (case-insensitive).
* For a given contact, adding a tag that already exists has no effect.
* Similarly, deleting a tag that does not exist has no effect.
* To clear all tags, use `t/` by itself.
* The same tag cannot be added and deleted in the same command.

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567`: Set the phone number of contact 1.
* `edit 1 d/Monday 18:00`: Set the weekly timeslot of contact 1.
* `edit 1 d/Wednesday 1800 - 1930 l/https://zoom.us/j/123456789 t/Tutor tdel/Student`: Set weekly timeslot + meeting link, add `Tutor` tag, and remove `Student` tag.
* `edit 2 t/`: Clear all tags of contact 2.

The first example gives the following expected output:

![result for 'edit 1 p/91234567'](images/EditCommandResult.png)

Expected behavior:
* The `edit` command succeeds even if the provided values are identical to the existing ones (i.e., no changes are made).

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Locating persons: <code>find</code></span>

💡 Find persons whose specified fields match the given keywords.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `find [m/MODE] [n/NAME]… [a/ADDRESS]… [p/PHONE]… [t/TAG]… [r/REMARK]… [d/WEEKLY_TIMESLOT]…`
</div>

* At least one prefixed keyword must be provided; unprefixed keywords are not allowed (e.g. `find Alex` is invalid).
* The search is case-insensitive for all fields.
* See [Command Rules](#command-rules) for shared constraints and behavior.
* Repeating prefixes are allowed. Users can perform either an OR search or an AND search.
* Each contact will appear at most once in the results, even if multiple fields match.
* For a given field in the search query, contacts missing that particular field will not be matched.
  * e.g. contacts without a phone number never match `p/…`).

Mode rules (`m`):
* `m/` is optional, case-insensitive, and accepts only `and` or `or` (at most once).
* Without this prefix, the default is OR semantics.
* `m/and` requires all provided keywords to match.
* `m/or` requires at least one provided condition to match.

Weekly timeslot rules (`d/`):
* The `d/` prefix in `FindCommand` is less strict, as it is used for searching.
* `d/` supports day-only, time-only, and day + time queries.
  * Day queries match contacts whose weekly timeslot falls on that day.
  * Single time queries match either an exact stored time or a stored range containing that time.
  * Range time queries match an exact stored range and may also match a stored single time within the query range.
  * Day + time/range queries must match both the day and the specified time or range.
* Flexible formats (e.g., `DD:HH–DDHH` or similar variations) are allowed.

Examples (Find people whose):
* `find n/alex a/geylang`: Name contains `alex` OR address contains `geylang`.
* `find m/and t/student n/clement`: Tagged `Student` AND name contains `clement`.
* `find d/1200 d/thu`: Weekly timeslot is `12:00` (or within a stored time range that includes `12:00`) or is on Thursday.
* `find d/tue 1500-1600`: Weekly timeslot is on Tuesday and is exactly `15:00 - 16:00` (or a stored single time within that range).

The first example gives the following expected output:

![result for 'find n/alex a/geylang'](images/FindCommandResult.png)

Expected behavior:
* `find p/ben` will not return an error, but will return no results (since phone numbers contain digits only).
* `find p/9` will not match contacts with no phone field (missing phone never matches `p/`).
* `find d/1500-1600` will not match a person whose time is `14:00 - 17:00` (range queries require an exact stored range match).
* `find t/best friend` will not return an error, but will return no results (as this is not a valid tag).

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Deleting a person: <code>del</code></span>

💡 Delete one or more specified persons from the address book.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `del ID [ID]…​`
</div>

* Deletes the persons with the specified `ID`s.
* Multiple IDs can be provided, separated by spaces.
* If any of the given IDs does not exist, none of the contacts will be deleted.

Examples:
* `del 2`: Delete the person with `ID` 2 from the address book.
* `del 1 3 5`: Delete the persons with `ID` 1, 3, and 5 from the address book atomically.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `del 1`: Delete the person with `ID` 1 from the address book. Note that it does not delete the first person in the results of the `find` command.
* `del 1 99`: Fail if either `ID` 1 or `ID` 99 is not found — neither contact will be deleted.

The first example gives the following expected output:

![result for 'del 2'](images/DeleteCommandResult.png)

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Copying a person information: <code>copy</code></span>

💡 Copy a specified field of a person from the address book to the user clipboard.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `copy ID FIELD`
</div>

* Possible fields include `n/` for name, `p/` for phone number, `a/` for address, and `l/` for meeting link.
* Copy is not supported for the weekly timeslot, tags, or remark fields. The `d/`, `t/`, `tdel/`, and `r/`
  fields are invalid for this command.
* If the person's field is empty, the command fails with an error message (nothing is copied to the clipboard).

Examples:
* `copy 6 n/`: Copy the name of the person with `ID` 6 to the clipboard.
* `copy 7 p/`: Copy the phone number of the person with `ID` 7 to the clipboard.
* `copy 9 a/`: Copy the address of the person with `ID` 9 to the clipboard.
* `copy 1 l/`: Copy the meeting link of the person with `ID` 1 to the clipboard.
* `copy 1 p/`: Fail if `ID` 1 is not found or the phone number field of the person with `ID` 1 is empty.

The fourth example gives the following expected output:

![result for 'copy 1 l/'](images/CopyCommandResult.png)

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Clearing all entries: <code>clear</code></span>

💡 Clear all entries from the address book with a two-step confirmation

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `clear`
</div>

* The first `clear` shows a warning and does not delete anything.
* The second consecutive `clear` deletes all contacts.
* If any other command is entered in between (including an invalid command), the confirmation resets.

Examples:
* `clear` then `clear` clears the address book.
* `clear` then `list` then `clear` will show the warning again (the confirmation is reset).

The first `clear` gives the following expected output:

![result for 'clear'](images/ClearCommandResult1.png)

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Exiting the program: <code>exit</code></span>

💡 Exit the program.

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
Format: `exit`
</div>
### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Saving the data</span>

EduConnect data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Editing the data file</span>

EduConnect data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/educonnect.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EduConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause EduConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## <span style="color:#FF6600;">Command Rules</span>

These rules apply across multiple commands in EduConnect:

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Command syntax</span>

* Command words and prefixes are case-sensitive and must be typed in lowercase.<br>
  e.g. `add n/Alex` is valid, but `Add n/Alex` and `add N/Alex` are invalid.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) are ignored, including any prefixes (e.g. m/).<br>
  e.g. `help 123 m/` is interpreted as `help`.

* Parameters can be in any order (unless stated otherwise).<br>
  e.g. `add p/98765432 n/Alex` is accepted.

* Leading and trailing spaces around prefixed values are ignored.<br>
  e.g. `add n/   Alex` is interpreted as `add n/Alex`.

* Leading zeroes are accepted and ignored.
  e.g., `edit 001 n/Ali` is interpreted as `edit 1 n/Ali`.

* `ID` format and behavior
  * `ID` is automatically assigned by the system.
  * `ID` is unique among all contacts currently in the contact list.
  * The `ID` assigned to a new contact is **1 greater than the current maximum ID** in the contact list.
  * If the contact with the highest `ID` is deleted, that `ID` may be reused by the next added contact.
      * e.g., if the current highest `ID` is `10` and contact `9` is deleted, the next added contact will have `ID` `11`.
      * e.g., if contact `10` is deleted, the next added contact will reuse `ID` `10`.
  * `ID` must be a positive integer (`1`, `2`, `3`, …).

* Empty values:
  * For `add`, providing an optional prefix with no value creates the contact with that field missing.<br>
    e.g. `add n/Jane Doe p/` creates a contact with no phone number.
  * For `edit`, providing a prefix with no value clears that field on the contact.<br>
    e.g. `edit 1 p/` clears the phone number of contact 1.
  * Exception (tags):
    * `add ... t/` is invalid. Omit `t/` to add a contact with no tags.
    * In `edit`, `t/` by itself clears all tags.
    * `tdel/` must be followed by a tag value (e.g. `tdel/Student`).

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Duplicate contacts</span>
* Two contacts are considered duplicates if they have the same name, phone number, and address. Name and address are compared case-insensitively.
* EduConnect does not allow duplicate contacts.
  * Adding a duplicate contact is invalid.
  * Editing a contact such that it becomes a duplicate of an existing contact is also invalid.

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Field constraints</span>

* `n/NAME`:
  * Must not be blank.
  * Must start with an alphabetic character.
  * Must contain only alphabets, `-`, `,`, `.`, `'` and spaces.
  * Names that contain special characters like `/` may need to be stored in an alternative format
    (e.g. `A/P` can be written as `AP` or `Anak Perempuan`, `S/O` can be written as `son of`).

* `p/PHONE_NUMBER`:
  * Must contain digits only.
  * Must start with `6`, `8`, or `9`.
  * Must be exactly 8 digits long.
  * Rationale (Singapore): `8`/`9` are typically mobile numbers, and `6` is typically fixed-line.
  * Reference: [IMDA National Numbering Plan (PDF)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/imda/files/regulation-licensing-and-consultations/frameworks-and-policies/numbering/national-numbering-plan-and-allocation-process/imda-national-numbering-plan.pdf)

* `a/ADDRESS`:
  * Should generally follow Singapore address format.
  * Unusual symbols or emojis are not prohibited, but are discouraged.
  * Must not contain forward slashes (`/`).
  * Reference: [Singapore address format](https://frasermclean.com/posts/singapore-address-format)

* `t/TAG`:
  * Must be one of `Student`, `Parent`, or `Tutor` (case-insensitive).
  * Repeating an existing tag has no effect because duplicate tags are not stored.

* `d/WEEKLY_TIMESLOT`:
  * Represents a weekly day/time (tuition sessions or recurring parent-tutor check-ins).
  * Accepted input forms (case insensitive):
    * day: accepts any unambiguous prefix with at least 2 letters (e.g., `d/mo`, `d/tue`)
    * single time: `Day HH:mm` or `Day HHmm`
    * time range: `Day HH:mm - HH:mm` or `Day HHmm - HHmm` (spaces around `-` are optional)
    * day must come before time (e.g. `d/tue 1500`, not `d/1500 tue`)
  * Valid weekdays: `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, `Sunday`.
  * Valid time: 24-hour time (`00:00` to `23:59`). A duration must not end before it starts.
  * Display is normalized (e.g. `monday 1800` → `Monday 18:00`).
  * Overlapping weekly timeslots across different contacts are allowed (e.g. staggered lessons for different students).

* `r/REMARK`:
  * Remark must not include:
    * tabs
    * newlines
    * forward slashes (`/`)
    * emojis

* `l/MEETING_LINK`:
  * If provided, it must be a valid URL starting with `http://` or `https://`, with no spaces in between.

### <span style="color:#d9730d;">Special case: Non-English characters in input</span>
* Non-English (Unicode) characters are supported only in `a/ADDRESS`. Other fields restrict input due to validation rules.
  * Example: `add n/adi a/爱德华七世宿舍` is accepted.
  * `find a/爱德华` can match partial non-English address text (substring match).
  * However, this is not recommended, as the system assumes English input.

## <span style="color:#FF6600;">FAQ</span>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduConnect home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <span style="color:#FF6600;">Known issues</span>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Only one running app instance can access the data file at a time**. If you open multiple app windows at the same time, data may not be saved properly. The remedy is to keep only one instance of EduConnect running at any time.
4. **When clicking between contacts in the list**, the displayed text may shift slightly, and the list may not auto-scroll to fully show the newly selected contact. This is expected UI behavior.
5. **If the user adds too many contacts and the ID overflows**, this exception is handled and the user is not allowed to add new contacts. In this case, the user must clear all data and start a new address book.
6. **The interface has a minimum window size**. EduConnect cannot be resized below a certain size; this is expected UI behavior.
